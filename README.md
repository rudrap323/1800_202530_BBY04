# Pantry Tracker


## Overview
Our team BBY 4 is making a fridge and pantry tracking app that helps roommates and family fairly split grocery responsibilities, avoid empty fridges and reduce food waste.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.
